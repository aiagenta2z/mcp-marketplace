To Get MCP Configs and Tools Please Visit MCP Marketplace at: https://www.deepnlp.org/store/ai-agent/mcp-server

### 1. Quick Start

**Install Requirements**
```
pip install fastapi pydantic dotenv asyncio httpx mcp_marketplace uuid 
```
or 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Start Service**

Under the root folder of the app ./mcp_tool_use, run below command:

```
uvicorn src.app:app --port 5000
```

Open browser and visit http://localhost:5000/mcp, and you will see a MCP admin page to enable, disable, restart and export available tools.

**Config Management mcp_config.json**

Go to <a>http://localhost:5000/mcp/config</a> and you can find the local config file of MCP servers <code>mcp_config.json</code>. You can click edit button and save your latest change. Remember to restart the servers.

<code>mcp_config.json</code> file is located in the path "./data/mcp/config/mcp_config.json".

```
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "google-maps": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps"],
            "env": {
                "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
            }
        },
        .,,
    }
}
```

**Start a Few MCP Servers**
For example, you can start google-maps,amap-amap-sse,baidu-map in the default config file. Without the Keys the agent can still decide the tools and parameters.
To make the MCP work, you need to setup the keys as in the mcp introduction.

#### 2.2 Programmable way to run MCP Tool Use Function Call

**CURL**

Once you started the service and run the target mcp server, you can run the tools calls through the REST API.

Let's say you want to post to server: <code>puppeteer</code> and test tools: <code>puppeteer_navigate</code> to navigate chrome to a webpage.

Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/query


```

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "server_id": "puppeteer",
    "tool_name": "puppeteer_navigate",
    "tool_input": {
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/list/cs/new"
    }
}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/query

```

Result 
```
{"success":true,"data":["Navigated to https://arxiv.org/list/cs/new"],"error":null}%
```


**REST GET/POST Request By Python/Typescript/etc**

For example, post request to MCP: amap-amap-sse, Tool: Get Weather and get local weather. You need to start mcp server 'amap-amap-sse' before running command line.

cd ./tests

```
python run_mcp_request.py

## define input_params
        input_params = {
            "server_id": "amap-amap-sse", 
            "tool_name": 'maps_weather',
            "tool_input": {
                "city": "乌鲁木齐"
            }
        }

```

Result
```
{'success': True, 'data': ['{"city":"乌鲁木齐市","forecasts":[{"date":"2025-06-30","week":"1","dayweather":"多云","nightweather":"多云","daytemp":"31","nighttemp":"20","daywind":"西北","nightwind":"西北","daypower":"1-3","nightpower":"1-3","daytemp_float":"31.0","nighttemp_float":"20.0"},{"date":"2025-07-01","week":"2","dayweather":"多云","nightweather":"多云","daytemp":"28","nighttemp":"20","daywind":"西北","nightwind":"西北","daypower":"1-3","nightpower":"1-3","daytemp_float":"28.0","nighttemp_float":"20.0"},{"date":"2025-07-02","week":"3","dayweather":"多云","nightweather":"多云","daytemp":"28","nighttemp":"20","daywind":"西北","nightwind":"西北","daypower":"1-3","nightpower":"1-3","daytemp_float":"28.0","nighttemp_float":"20.0"},{"date":"2025-07-03","week":"4","dayweather":"多云","nightweather":"晴","daytemp":"30","nighttemp":"21","daywind":"西北","nightwind":"西北","daypower":"1-3","nightpower":"1-3","daytemp_float":"30.0","nighttemp_float":"21.0"}]}'], 'error': None}
```
