### 5. MCP Client `mcpm` CLI tool for Personal Use or Benchmark Purpose

**Installation**

You can install the command line `mcpm` from mcp-marketplace pypi package, and start a MCP Client using local 
`mcp_config.json` file

```
## Basic Usage MCP Index and Search
pip install mcp-marketplace

## MCPClient Supports User Defined mcp_config.json, Just Like Other Clients Cursor/Claude
pip install mcp-marketplace[mcp_tool_use] 
```

The CLI 'mcpm' will be in python path

``` 
mcp run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000

## Use Local Config File
cd python/tests

mcpm run --port 5000 --config "./mcp_config_onekey.json"

mcpm run --port 5000 --config "./mcp_config.json"

```

Then you can visit http://0.0.0.0:5000 for web console and 
http://0.0.0.0:5000/mcp for mcp management


#### Benchmark

You can also run various MCP benchmark using the rest API From the Client

| API | Description                                                                      |
| ---- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /api/query | The endpoint which you can post the tool parameters to get the tool/call results |


**CURL Tests**

Once you started the service and run the target mcp server, you can run the tools calls through the REST API.

Let's say you want to post to server: <code>puppeteer</code> and test tools: <code>puppeteer_navigate</code> to navigate chrome to a webpage.

Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/query

```

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "server_id": "puppeteer",
    "tool_name": "puppeteer_navigate",
    "tool_input": {
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/list/cs/new"
    }
}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/query

```

Result 
```
{"success":true,"data":["Navigated to https://arxiv.org/list/cs/new"],"error":null}%
```


**REST GET/POST Request By Python/Typescript/etc**

For example, post request to MCP: amap-amap-sse, Tool: Get Weather and get local weather. You need to start mcp server 'amap-amap-sse' before running command line.

cd ./tests

```
python run_mcp_request.py

## define input_params
        input_params = {
            "server_id": "amap-amap-sse", 
            "tool_name": 'maps_weather',
            "tool_input": {
                "city": "乌鲁木齐"
            }
        }

```

Result
```
{'success': True, 'data': ['{"city":"乌鲁木齐市","forecasts":[{"date":"2025-06-30","week":"1","dayweather":"多云","nightweather":"多云","daytemp":"31","nighttemp":"20","daywind":"西北","nightwind":"西北","daypower":"1-3","nightpower":"1-3","daytemp_float":"31.0","nighttemp_float":"20.0"},{"date":"2025-07-01","week":"2","dayweather":"多云","nightweather":"多云","daytemp":"28","nighttemp":"20","daywind":"西北","nightwind":"西北","daypower":"1-3","nightpower":"1-3","daytemp_float":"28.0","nighttemp_float":"20.0"},{"date":"2025-07-02","week":"3","dayweather":"多云","nightweather":"多云","daytemp":"28","nighttemp":"20","daywind":"西北","nightwind":"西北","daypower":"1-3","nightpower":"1-3","daytemp_float":"28.0","nighttemp_float":"20.0"},{"date":"2025-07-03","week":"4","dayweather":"多云","nightweather":"晴","daytemp":"30","nighttemp":"21","daywind":"西北","nightwind":"西北","daypower":"1-3","nightpower":"1-3","daytemp_float":"30.0","nighttemp_float":"21.0"}]}'], 'error': None}
